# Serverless demo

A demo of how to use wink with [Zeit's serverless functions](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction). Currently it has only one API endpoint `/api/wink-pos-tagger` that takes a `sentence` parameter. You can see an example [here](https://showcase-serverless.winkjs.now.sh/api/wink-pos-tagger?sentence=He%20is%20trying%20to%20fish%20for%20fish%20in%20the%20lake.).
